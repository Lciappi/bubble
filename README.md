Real estate prices across the world have been increasing until the point where it is no longer affordable to live near large cities. Taipei alone has had a 70% increase in housing prices from 2005 to 2014 (Chen). Therefore, we wanted to make a regression model that would predict the reasonable cost of a house per unit area based on the most accurate predictors. This will give the buyers an idea of how much they should be paying for a property. 
Specifically, our question is **“According to the distance to the nearest metro station and number of convenience stores nearby, what is the price of a house per unit area in New-Taipei?”**
The data set we will be using contains real estate data from Sindian Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan from 2012-2013. This data sets contains 7 variables:

* Transaction date
* House age (year)
* The distance to the nearest Metro station (metre) 
* The number of convenience stores nearby (in the living circle on foot)
* The geographic coordinate, latitude (degree)
* The geographic coordinate, longitude (degree)
* House price of unit area (10000 New Taiwan Dollar/Ping, where 1 Ping = 3.3 meter squared)
